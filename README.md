# Quasiparticle Interference Simulation and Analysis

The `QPIsim` package (short for _QPI simulation_) is a set of functions and scripts for simulating quasiparticle interference and comparing to scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements.

### Summary
Quasiparticle interference acquried from STM is an accurate and effective way to study quantum behavior of electrons on the surface of single crystals. However, sometimes detailed understanding of experimental observations is challenging due to the coupling of different effects. Therefore, a theoretical simulation that incorporate different effects is highly desired for quantatitive comparison with experimental observations. This package offers algorithms for fast simulation of QPI, hoping to advance the field of QPI research.
